Description
---------------

It was written in response to the annoying restrictions Blizzard added
in WoW 4.0 (Cataclysm) that prevented most buff addons from letting you
cancel buffs on right-click. With CancelMyBuffs, you simply choose which
buffs you want to remove, add them to a group, and bind a key to the
group. When you press the chosen key, all of the buffs in that group are
removed. Dismounting, leaving vehicles, leaving shapeshift forms, and
removing weapon buffs are also supported.

For example, I have Ctrl+X bound to a CancelMyBuffs binding that cancels
all Slow Fall and Water Walking effects, dismounts me, leaves my vehicle,
and cancels my shapeshift form. Tanks may find it useful to bind a key
to cancel Hand of Protection and other similar effects.


Options
-----------

Type "/cmb" for options, or find them in the Interface Options window.

Key bindings are saved on a per-profile basis. Buffs and buff groups
are saved globally, so you don't have to set them up all over again for
every different character you play.
