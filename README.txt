## Features

CancelMyBuffs lets you easily cancel unwanted buffs.

You simply bind a key and choose which buffs you want to cancel, ahead 
of time. Then, when you press the key, all of the buffs you chose are 
cancelled. It also supports dismounting, exiting vehicles, cancelling 
forms, and removing weapon buffs.

Type ``/cmb`` for options, or find them in the Interface Options window. 
You can also set the keybinding in the Blizzard keybindings UI.

CancelMyBuffs was written in response to the annoying restrictions added
by Blizzard in WoW 4.0 that prevent most buff addons from letting you 
cancel buffs on right-click. It's slightly less flexible, since you have 
to set up a fixed list of buffs you want to cancel ahead of time, but 
once you've done that, it is faster than hunting through buff icons to 
click off Hand of Protection. Plus, it works no matter which buff addon 
you use.
