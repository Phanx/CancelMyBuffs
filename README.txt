## Features

CancelMyBuffs lets you easily cancel unwanted buffs.

You simply bind a key and choose which buffs you want to cancel, ahead
of time. Then, when you press the key, all of the buffs you chose are
cancelled. It also supports dismounting, exiting vehicles, cancelling
forms, and removing weapon buffs.

Type ``/cmb`` for options, or find them in the Interface Options window.
You can also set the keybinding in the Blizzard keybindings UI.

CancelMyBuffs was written in response to the annoying restrictions added
by Blizzard in WoW 4.0 that prevent most buff addons from letting you
cancel buffs on right-click. It's slightly less flexible, since you have
to set up a fixed list of buffs you want to cancel ahead of time, but
once you've done that, it is faster than hunting through buff icons to
click off Hand of Protection. Plus, it works no matter which buff addon
you use.
