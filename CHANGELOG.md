* This version has been completely rewritten from the ground up, with a focus on configurability.
* You can now create as many bindings as you want, add your own buffs and buff groups in-game, and remove any bindings, buffs, or buff groups you don't want. You can configure whether a buff should always be included in a group, only included when you know the spell, or only included on some classes.
* Bindings are saved on a per-profile basis. Buffs and buff groups are saved on a global basis, so they are available to all profiles.
