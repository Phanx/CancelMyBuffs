Features
--------

CancelMyBuffs lets you easily cancel unwanted buffs.

You simply bind a key and choose which buffs you want to cancel, ahead 
of time. Then, when you press the key, all of the buffs you chose are 
cancelled. It also supports dismounting, exiting vehicles, cancelling 
forms, and removing weapon buffs.

Type “/cmb” for options, or find them in the Interface Options window. 
You can also set the keybinding in the Blizzard keybindings UI.

CancelMyBuffs was written in response to Blizzard’s new restrictions in 
WoW 4.0 that prevent most buff addons from letting you cancel buffs on 
right-click. It’s slightly less flexible, since you have to set up a 
fixed list of buffs you want to cancel ahead of time, but once you’ve 
done that, it is faster than hunting through buff icons to click off 
Hand of Protection. Plus, it works no matter which buff addon you use.


Future Plans
------------

In the future, you will be able to add custom buffs, set up visible 
and/or audible alerts when you gain certain buffs, and set up multiple 
keybindings that each cancel different sets of buffs.


Limitations
-----------

Due to Blizzard restrictions, it is not possible to cancel a buff only 
if certain conditions are met. For example, you cannot cancel Aspect of 
the Cheetah only if you’re Dazed. When you press your chosen key, all 
of the buffs on your list will be cancelled if you have them, and the 
list cannot be edited while in combat.


Localization
------------

CancelMyBuffs is compatible with English, Deutsch, Español, Français, 
Русский, 한국어, 简体中文, and 正體中文 game clients.

CancelMyBuffs is currently translated into English. If you can provide 
translations for any locale, send me a PM.
